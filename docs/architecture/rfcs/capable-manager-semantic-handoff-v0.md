## Document map and maintenance contract

Sections 1–3 and 5–12 are proposed normative design and acceptance requirements. Section 4 records source-audited baseline facts, not deployment claims. Appendices preserve rationale and evidence; Appendix C separates official Grok Bot documentation from implementation unknowns and LoopX design decisions. English and Chinese are semantic mirrors. This RFC does not declare new tools, schemas, permissions or migrations implemented merely by naming them.

This is the proposed product-level successor to the staged **Manager evidence and continuity v0** design. Keep that protocol as the implementation/migration reference until individual milestones replace its restrictions. Absorb the pending same-Goal handoff design from [#4312](https://github.com/huangruiteng/loopx/pull/4312) as a migration input, not an architectural restriction. Refine the manager portions of Desktop Frontends and Goal Channel, preserving direct conversations with working Agents. Integrate the merged [explicit continuation Stage A](cross-session-memory-substrate-v0.md) from #4094 as the existing CLI/ownership-transfer adapter, retaining its bounded contract until the replacement qualifies (§5.13). Do not replace the effect interpreter, Goal Vision/Replan or shared-authority RFCs.

## 1. Decision summary

Build the manager as a **capable, persistent agent on the user's host**, using the installed runtime's normal tools and skills under the owner's durable authority. It should investigate, decide, do appropriately scoped work, and coordinate workers. Reading a repository must not require inventing a repository-specific manager protocol when ordinary file/Git/API tools already solve the task.

Build handoff as **continuation of work with semantic state**, not only forwarding a sentence or generating a Todo edit. Preserve purpose, context, decisions, constraints, evidence, current commitments and the expected return. Preserve LoopX's authoritative work semantics while refactoring their implementation into a coherent collaboration boundary. Existing module locations, file layouts and manager-only protocols are migration inputs, not constraints on the target design.

The comparison target is the persistent **Grok Bot** product, not only `@grok` on X. **Always available is not the same as long-horizon.** The former keeps an agent reachable; the latter sustains a goal through execution, evidence, replanning, interruption and acceptance. LoopX's architectural advantage is making connected agents long-horizon through durable task and continuation semantics, rather than requiring each runtime to invent them. This RFC brings that strength to the manager and handoff. Grok Bot documents persistence and asynchronous collaboration; the reviewed sources do not establish equivalent goal-continuation guarantees. That evidence limit is not proof that Grok Bot cannot do long tasks. Appendix C grounds the comparison; Section 5.11 and acceptance tests make the LoopX claim concrete.

The division of responsibility is:

- The agent decides how to investigate, whom to involve and what the evidence means.
- LoopX owns accepted Goal/Todo/Vision/claim/evidence transitions and recoverable coordination.
- The runtime owns tool execution, session persistence and actual host permissions.
- Frontend and Lark are conversation/feedback entrances to the same service, scoped to their audiences.

For an authenticated owner on a configured trusted host, the intended default is useful autonomy within existing grants, including ordinary reversible work without repeated approval. Restricted/shared-audience operation remains available. Neither a message nor a capability switch silently expands OS, provider or audience authority. This RFC proposes that default change; it does not activate it.

## 2. Problem and motivation

A user asks a manager to review a change, incorporate several follow-up constraints, coordinate implementation and report back. The current experience can fail independently at each step:

| Friction | Architectural diagnosis | Required change |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A strong model repeatedly says it lacks a PR diff available through local tools | Read-only planner instructions and a narrow projected context define its effective ceiling | Give the manager normal permitted investigative tools and enough task context |
| An explicit instruction becomes a preview requiring another confirmation | Chat proposal mode is confused with the owner's already-authorized intent | Match existing authority and execute or delegate; ask only for a real missing decision |
| A routing list omits the appropriate worker | Discovery is treated as a fixed allowlist of responsibilities | Discover registered active agents, inspect roles/work and select best effort |
| A worker gets “review the points above” without the points | Original-message fidelity does not preserve conversational meaning | Carry relevant context and its provenance, alongside the original input |
| “Forwarded” is reported although the worker has not assessed it | Transport, interpretation, work and return delivery are collapsed | Preserve independent receipts and automatically return a useful conclusion |
| A complete answer is replaced by a format-error notice | User text and control output share a fragile decoding/delivery path | Separate control effects, saved answer and transport recovery |

These failures have different causes. A better model can improve investigation and routing; it cannot guarantee delivery or reconstruct missing context. A denser packet cannot compensate for a runtime forbidden to inspect the evidence it references. Both assumptions must be implemented and tested together.

### Invariants

1. One authoritative owner per kind of work state; no editable manager copy of progress.
2. Existing durable authorization is reused; genuine missing authority remains visible.
3. Read access, action permission and permission to disclose the result are distinct.
4. Receipt, assessment, plan change, completed work and delivered answer never stand in for one another.
5. A worker controls its plan and accepted commitments. Delegation does not silently interrupt it or raise priority.
6. An unresolved request survives restarts and context compaction; failures produce actionable feedback.

## 3. Scope and non-goals

Include global manager conversations, host-native investigation, ordinary authorized actions, responsibility discovery, semantic handoff, receiver planning, automatic return, cross-entrypoint visibility and recovery. Support manager→worker and worker→worker as two real consumers of the same handoff semantics.

Do not build a replacement agent runtime, a second scheduler, an external-agent marketplace, a new repository API, a universal workflow DSL or a duplicate task database. A substantial refactor of the current manager, collaboration and adapter boundaries is explicitly in scope; conserving current code volume or module names is not an acceptance goal. Do not require OpenViking, a shared online database or A2A to make local handoffs correct. Do not copy private reasoning traces or complete historical transcripts into every request. Complex financial and other domain effects remain owned by their capabilities and execution adapters.

## 4. Current-system contract: audited facts

The baseline already has substantial reusable machinery:

| Existing owner | Source / fact | Consequence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Manager identity/config | `loopx/chat_manager.py`: `open_manager_session`, `manager_workspace`, `manager_model_config` | Stable global role, audience-derived private workspace, `resume_latest`; default Codex model is `gpt-6-astra` / `high` |
| Host execution | `loopx/chat_agent.py`: `_turn_prompt`, `CodexChatAgentSession.start`; `loopx/chat_runtime.py`: adapter creation/restoration | Codex app-server start/resume exists. Planning uses read-only sandbox and never approvals; only the manager read dynamic tool is added by this path |
| Manager behavioral restriction | `MANAGER_AGENT_OBJECTIVE` and the planning prompt | Shell/arbitrary repository reads and mutations are restricted; outside intent delegation, durable changes become preview/apply proposals |
| Session restoration | `loopx/chat_runtime.py` | Saved upstream identity is resumed when compatible; context-version and audience changes can force a new thread. This is not evidence that every deployed request resumes successfully |
| Evidence reads | `manager_context/inspection.py`, `ssh_evidence.py`, global-manager CLI | Core portfolio/Todo/delivery reads, pagination and host provenance exist; the initial projection is not full external artifact evidence |
| Context transfer | `manager_context/__init__.py` | Original ingress provenance, exact recipient, request digest, inbox and receiver hook exist; the current wire is `loopx_manager_context_entry_v1` |
| [#4094](https://github.com/huangruiteng/loopx/pull/4094) explicit Todo continuation | `coordination/todo_continuation.ts`, `local_authority_runtime.ts` | Existing promoted-local path for a current, lease-free Todo and registered same-machine agents; not a general pre-Todo/cross-Goal/leased handoff |
| Return path | `manager_context/tracking.py`, `roundtrip.py` | Read, acknowledge, canonical Todo/evidence links, immutable reply and return transport exist; preserve these facts during replacement, without keeping duplicate transition owners |
| Semantic work state | Goal Vision/Replan protocol and typed control plane | Agent-scoped direction, acceptance, path delta, current Todos, evidence and claims already describe work beyond status labels |
| UI | `apps/presentation/dashboard/src/data/chat.ts`, `chat-model.ts`, capability settings/workbench | Existing conversation and configuration projections should expose the richer runtime and exchange |

A separate pending [#4312](https://github.com/huangruiteng/loopx/pull/4312) at `13085665a9377f160025ec6c01885e889f0df5c9` adds same-Goal agent handoff. Its proposed `agent_handoff.py` owns a Todo/from/to-derived dispatch identity and dispatched/read/claim receipts; this is outside the named `main` baseline. Treat its same-Goal, unclaimed-Todo and independent-review predicates as the semantics of that specific dispatch path, not universal rules for all work requests. Its `same-goal-agent-handoff-inbox-v0` RFC should be absorbed as a historical adapter/migration reference when this direction is accepted.

The reviewed [PR #4306](https://github.com/huangruiteng/loopx/pull/4306), subsequently closed as recorded in Appendix B, proposed a special GitHub evidence reader with revision guards, pagination, typed failure handling and routing policy. Its latest reviewed shape was read-first, so it was not merely a forwarding workaround. Nevertheless, the manager should not need this additional per-resource tool surface for ordinary host investigation. Section 6 rejects it as the chosen product path, retaining useful regression requirements.

### 4.1 Cross-RFC implementation checkpoint

Rechecked `origin/main` at the implementation baseline above on 2026-09-13. These are source/history findings, not fresh deployment qualification. RFC status and shipped slices must be reported separately; an old index or a merged refactor title is insufficient.

| Contract | Verified foundation at this baseline | Still outside this RFC's delivery claim |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **TS migration** | Accepted; Stage 1/2A foundations and active Stage 2B transaction cutovers. `todos/public_update.ts`, `coordination/todo_update.ts`, `todo_monitor_poll.ts` and structured consumers already own substantial semantics. | T0–T4 are a continuing execution plan, not all completed. Native field/lease/monitor support remains bounded. Moving a planner to TS is not moving its commit. |
| **Shared authority** | Draft with implemented foundations. `AuthorityStore` defines conditional durable state/events/receipt commit, readback and scan. [#4280](https://github.com/huangruiteng/loopx/pull/4280), [#4283](https://github.com/huangruiteng/loopx/pull/4283), [#4287](https://github.com/huangruiteng/loopx/pull/4287) consolidate transaction, presentation and retained-journal semantics. File/NoKV and SQLite/PostgreSQL candidate paths exist. | A provider implementation is not default promotion or a shared service. D1 projection, D2 profile qualification/soak and D3 fenced cutover retain their own evidence and approval conditions. |
| **Shared Goal alignment/amendment** | Draft with Stage 1/2 foundations: `goals/shared_goal_alignment.{py,ts}` reads the current work basis; `goal_amendment_proposal.{py,ts}` validates/retains proposals with no canonical effect. Their source basis includes canonical Todo/lease revision when promoted. | Complete Goal-intent versioning, governed Stage 3 commit, verifier/lease-impact handling and its qualification are not supplied by proposal admission. An event sequence or Todo provider revision is not the full Goal revision. |
| **Manager and handoff (#4330)** | Existing manager inbox/context/tracking/return paths are the migration source; Section 4 identifies their owners. | Capable profile promotion, the general collaboration transaction and A1–A16 remain proposed. This RFC must consume the other owners rather than implement them again. |

Supplemental checkpoint at `6b337bcbde8457bc3268ec7d2780367ace3c6147`: merged #4286 (`c0b572d2d508bb10c32701057dd71ff4f8eb663c`) adds `coordination/command_receipt.ts` as the shared recovery owner for canonical Todo commands and separates archive transactions into `todo_archive.ts`. Its File/SQLite/PostgreSQL/NoKV conformance matrix is reusable M2 foundation, not a capability to design again. Use the original-operation ambiguous recovery semantics when reconciling request/work commits. This removes duplicate TS transaction rules, not Python writers, T1/T2 gaps or D1–D3 promotion requirements.

### 4.2 Four questions, four ownership boundaries

- **#4330:** how does the user give work to a capable manager, how is its meaning continued by another agent, and how does the conclusion return?
- **Alignment/amendment:** which shared objective and acceptance remain binding, when may an agent replan its own lane, and which shared changes may be committed?
- **Shared authority:** which state transition actually committed, who holds a current lease, and how are the original receipt and one writable source recovered?
- **TS migration:** where are those semantic decisions and complete transactions implemented, which adapters remain, and when can their old rules/writers be deleted?

These are complementary contracts. A manager is not a Goal-amendment authority; a collaboration ledger is not the Todo authority; a database is not an agent planner; translating code does not promote a provider. The integration rules below take precedence over interpreting a proposed module name as a new owner of all four concerns.

## 5. Proposed architecture

### 5.1 A persistent, capable manager

  M <--> C["LoopX: work state, authority, evidence"]

  R --> U
```

Keep a neutral private manager workspace to avoid inheriting one project's identity. This is an instruction home, not the limit of knowledge. Supply the host/project catalog and let the runtime access owner-authorized repositories, documents, tools and configured hosts. Load project instructions when entering that project's work; local-repository availability does not establish its HEAD equals a remote PR HEAD.

Use the installed runtime's filesystem, shell, Git/`gh`, web and appropriate connector capabilities directly. Reuse LoopX CLI/skills for structured state; retain `loopx_manager_read` as a convenient high-quality read model, not the only knowledge channel. Domain skills teach methods. They must not become a fresh wrapper around every normal tool. An unavailable cache prompts another permitted authoritative source, not a repeated generic disclaimer. A real permission or policy denial is not treated as a cache failure to circumvent.

The manager performs short investigations and routine reversible work directly. It delegates sustained, specialized or independently owned work, and can consult workers without transferring ownership. It explains its decision when useful. It must not hand everything off merely because it is called a manager, or absorb every engineering task and become a bottleneck.

At session start, expose the effective host, model/effort, accessible resource classes, tool availability, relevant standing grants and instruction revisions. Separate configured preference from verified runtime capability. For the existing Codex adapter, keep the current strong model default; providers retain explicit equivalent profiles. Do not request hidden reasoning traces as evidence of intelligence.

### 5.2 Target boundaries: refactor around work, not the manager

The target has three product/technical owners:

1. **Manager agent application:** conversation continuity, investigation, judgment, delegation, synthesis and user feedback. Its AGENTS/skills teach LoopX state discovery and collaboration. Its ordinary tools come from the host runtime. It does not own an independent handoff ledger or invent low-level workflow steps for every user request.
2. **Core collaboration bounded context:** general work-request identity, versioned semantic context, assessment/result relations, transfer/cancellation requests and immutable receipts. Move generic transitions out of `manager_context` into the established TypeScript control plane, with one owner for request transitions. A prospective `control_plane/collaboration` boundary is a design location, not a new shipped CLI or replacement authority/store. Existing Goal/Todo/Vision/lease owners commit changes to their own objects; collaboration invokes them and records their receipts. Section 5.12 defines the transaction and storage boundary.
3. **Runtime and channel adapters:** discover/register agent addresses, present requests at supported loop boundaries, persist transport intents and map provider events to receipts. Codex, CLI, managed Turn, Lark and frontend consume the same collaboration semantics. Transport bookkeeping is not ownership of work completion.

A work request is first-class and may exist **before a Todo**. Consultation can resolve with a reasoned answer and evidence; accepted implementation can attach one or more existing/new Todos. Handoff can stay within one Goal, connect distinct Goals, or reach a registered host. Neither `same Goal`, `unclaimed Todo`, `source excluded`, nor an installed domain capability is a universal admission predicate. Those checks apply only to the specific effect whose contract needs them, such as an independent-review claim.

Work-request identity derives from origin plus an immutable request ID/revision. Do not use only `(goal, todo, from, to)` as universal identity: a second review round of the same Todo is new work, while retrying the same round is not. Changing recipient creates a recorded reassignment/dispatch attempt; old attempts remain reconcilable. Consultation, delegated work and ownership transfer are distinct intents expressed within this one contract, not three unrelated inbox implementations.

For a small local manager action, a current request/Turn and accepted effect receipt can be enough. Do not manufacture a Todo, target-capability, repository identity and validation command merely to read a file, answer a question or record an ordinary note. Durable implementation work still benefits from explicit tasks, scope and validation. Domain-capability checks belong to effects requiring that capability; capability registration is not universal permission to think or investigate.

The durable semantic context consists of a small typed identity/control header plus a versioned human-readable brief and resolvable work/artifact references. The header drives routing and legal transitions. The brief carries open-ended domain meaning; Core does not classify every sentence into a rigid schema. This is dense general-task state, not serialization of the model's hidden thoughts. The same context remains available when a runtime session is replaced.

Prefer one cohesive replacement to compatibility wrappers that preserve duplicate decisions. Inventory every existing producer/reader, migrate with lossless mappings, switch one writer and delete the replaced rules. Reusing contracts and data is required; reusing every current class, JSON directory and prompt is not.

### 5.3 Authority that enables work

Resolve a request from authenticated principal, origin/audience, resource scope and requested effect, then match the existing persistent grant. A grant is reused across turns and restarts until revoked, expired or outside scope. Authorized delegation may carry an attenuated reference to a real standing grant; handoff is not inherently powerless. The receiver verifies the grant chain, target/action scope and its own host authority. It neither trusts a model-written permission string nor requires the user to approve the same in-scope work again. Read-only discovery, direct reversible effects and protected operations keep their actual permission semantics; none is forced through a second confirmation merely because the entrypoint is chat.

For a trusted owner-private manager, grant the normal host-agent tool profile that the owner configured. For a shared/untrusted audience, run a restricted context with enforceable resource/tool limits. A broad private process followed only by output filtering is **not** sufficient isolation. A verified owner message in a group may trigger private work with a separately scoped return, when a standing policy permits it; other participants do not inherit that policy.

LoopX state mutations always use the existing typed command boundary, even if initiated through shell. The manager does not edit registry/authority files behind the control plane. Repository modifications use the project's normal worktree/review practice. Scoped merge/deploy authorization may be reused; unrelated payment or trading authority cannot be inferred from it.

If an approval bridge is needed, it presents the exact operation and existing grant mismatch and waits for a real answer. A noninteractive `approvalPolicy=never` rejection must not be misreported as the user refusing. Host policy, provider rejection and application restrictions remain separate diagnoses. This design does not attempt to bypass an upstream safety decision.

### 5.4 Semantic density: preserve what changes the next decision

LoopX state is richer than a task queue. A handoff should enable the receiver to reconstruct **why the work exists, what is true, what remains uncertain and what it may change**, using current authoritative objects plus durable contextual material. Density means useful decision relationships, not maximum text length or a giant schema.

The proposed handoff read model composes the following; these are semantic slots, not a requirement to create a new persisted field for each row:

| Slot | Meaning / owner |
| --- | --- |
| Identity and causality | Stable request, conversation/origin event, parent request, handoff revision, exact sender/receiver and return route; host/control-owned |
| Intent and expected outcome | Original user input plus a faithful operational summary and completion question; source-labelled, not a new permission grant |
| Relevant conversational context | Referenced messages/documents, subsequent corrections, source/digest and summary provenance; not unrelated transcript history |
| Current work and commitments | References to Goal, Agent Vision, Todos, dependencies, claims/leases and accepted milestones at known revisions |
| Decision context | Relevant alternatives, rejected paths, constraints, assumptions, uncertainties and rationale summaries; author/confidence/evidence distinguished |
| Evidence and access | Locators, source revision/time, verified vs recorded claim, scope and actual read status; a hash alone is not a fetchable artifact |
| Change request | What new information asks the receiver to reconsider; what must be retained; desired urgency vs an authorized priority change |
| Result contract | Required decision/work/artifacts, permitted audience, next condition if deferred, and who owes the eventual answer |

Reuse immutable source messages, current work objects and artifact references. Store a concise semantic brief only for information not already represented, with revision and provenance. Machine authority comes from typed accepted commands; neither quoted material nor a model-written summary is an authority token. User requests inside source messages are distinguished from third-party quoted instructions.

Do not put the entire handoff inside Goal Vision's bounded summary or expand every TurnEnvelope by the size of the source corpus. Keep the prompt projection small and task-adaptive; pin the brief and unresolved constraints, and provide real permitted drill-down to the full source. A projection must disclose omissions. Reject oversized writes explicitly or externalize them through the existing artifact owner; never silently remove a user constraint. This RFC does not change existing field budgets.

### 5.5 Responsibility discovery and receiver-owned planning

Discover all registered active Goals and their agents within authorized host scope. Stopped Goals are excluded by default but can be requested. Discoverability, read access, context delivery and execution permission are four separate facts. “Best effort” means the manager investigates role, current work, repository and availability; it does not mean broadcasting private context or guessing an identity.

Prefer the explicitly named receiver; otherwise resolve the best responsible agent from current state. A missing convenience routing profile must not make a known authorized worker nonexistent. Avoid fixed per-request catalogs as the only responsibility model. If several agents fit, choose an assessment owner and say why; clarify only when ambiguity materially changes authority or outcome. If no worker is suitable, do the permitted work locally or report the actual missing capability. Do not silently start a new user task or wake a stopped Goal.

The receiver gets the packet at a supported safe interaction boundary. The existing turn-start hook is the baseline; an attached runtime may support prompt delivery at its next safe continuation point. Always publish whether the target is reachable, queued until wake, or unsupported. Inbox storage does not prove injection into a model session, and injection does not prove adoption.

The receiver compares the new request to current state, records adopted/partially adopted/deferred/rejected with a concise reason, and applies any plan change through its own canonical Todo/Vision workflow. `partial` must identify the accepted and unresolved parts. A deferred outcome names a resume condition and owner; it must not silently close an execution request still owed. Explicit cancellation/reprioritization requires the corresponding current authority and receipt.

### 5.6 One exchange, independent durable facts

The user-facing exchange is **received → assessed/working → result**, with meaningful updates when needed. Internally, keep transport and work facts separate:

| Fact | Evidence required |
| --- | --- |
| Accepted at ingress | Durable source/request identity; no claim the worker has read it |
| Delivered to receiver inbox | Exact target and persisted payload revision |
| Presented to a worker turn | Host receipt for that request/revision and runtime turn; legacy `read` is not proof of comprehension |
| Assessed | Receiver decision, accepted scope, plan/evidence references or specific deferral |
| Work resolved | Result satisfies the request's completion question, or an explicit rejection/cancellation/terminal inability |
| Answer delivered | Provider receipt/readback for the original route and answer revision; distinct from resolution |

Migrate current inbox/tracking/roundtrip records into the single collaboration owner; preserve their valid effect semantics and receipts, but retire duplicate manager-specific transition logic after cutover. Persist intent before dispatch; use request revision plus effect identity for idempotency. A changed payload cannot reuse an immutable identity; a correction appends a linked revision and the receiver rechecks relevant state before effectful execution. Multiple messages about one job may be explicitly related by the manager, preserving each original obligation and correction. Do not merge independent same-text requests by a content hash alone.

At-least-once delivery with idempotent Core effects is the target. Do not promise exactly-once external effects: uncertain sends are reconciled using provider receipts before retry. Concurrent workers use existing claims/leases; delegation does not claim the worker's Todo. Cross-host operation uses configured transport and authority, not a bare local path copied to another machine.

The receiver commits result/evidence links and audience-ready text. The manager may synthesize multiple worker outcomes into one answer, maintaining request-level coverage. A deterministic outbox delivers an already committed result even if the manager model is unavailable. If synthesis is required, persist that duty; do not let an optional synthesis step erase the worker's result. Model retries never replay an already accepted action.

### 5.7 Session and product continuity

One manager identity has logical conversations scoped by audience/authority. Resume a compatible upstream thread in the same runtime home. Refresh current Core state and pending requests every turn; session memory is not current truth. On incompatible scope/tool changes or missing sessions, recover from durable context with a recorded reason, preserving unresolved work. Do not restart simply to reapply ordinary context; do not import runtime database rows across homes.

Frontend and Lark share request/result identity and authorized facts. Equivalent authorized surfaces may show the same conversation; other groups must not receive private history. The frontend shows conversation, worker, brief, current work/result and delivery status. A saved answer not delivered to Lark is visible as such and is recoverable without rerunning work. Lark shows timely receipt, substantive result and necessary next action; multi-part output or a readable attachment preserves lengthy content. It must not force the user to ask where every handoff went.

Keep protocol effects separate from visible text. Reuse host tool/function calls and typed receipts for actions where supported; a compatibility decoder must quarantine malformed control envelopes while recovering independently valid display text. Never infer or execute an effect from a recovered answer. Formatting failure is a transport incident, not new work for the model.

### 5.8 One concrete exchange across several messages

A user asks to review a capability PR, then adds “keep lifecycle behavior in hooks; preserve enough context; have the engineering agent implement the conclusion.” The manager reads the repository and actual PR through normal tools, relates the follow-up messages, and keeps the distinction between verified findings and requested design preferences. If the work merits delegation, the semantic brief includes the exact review target/revision, all three constraints, evidence, current accepted commitments and the required return: a review decision plus implementation/validation outcome.

The engineering worker reads the brief and current state, checks its own authority, adopts or contests the design, and updates its plan. New findings may justify a different implementation; they do not justify silently forgetting a user constraint. Its result links the work, validation and remaining limitations. The original conversation receives that result automatically, even after reconnect. A subsequent user correction becomes a linked revision, not a second disconnected queue entry or an overwrite of an already executed decision.

The same contract works when a research worker asks another worker to countercheck a source: no repository or existing Todo is required to express the question, disagreement and evidence. That second consumer is the concrete test that the abstraction is about general work rather than a manager-branded router.

### 5.9 Replacement map and refactor acceptance

| Current seam | Target | Retirement condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Manager inherits Chat planning-only restrictions and JSON preview fallback | Dedicated capable-manager role using native host tools and accepted effect receipts; keep explicit plan-only mode for users who select it | M1 proves ordinary authorized actions and restricted-mode parity; remove contradictory manager instructions |
| Manager context inbox plus same-Goal Todo-handoff rules | One collaboration work-request contract with referenced semantic context and intent-specific admission | M2 lossless migration and two-consumer conformance; remove duplicate identities and transitions |
| `manager_context` owns generic dispatch/decision semantics in Python | Core TypeScript collaboration domain; Python calls the typed boundary and adapts runtime/channel I/O | Switch one writer after differential tests, then delete the old decision implementation |
| #4094 explicit continuation CLI, rich Todo note and transfer grant | Worker→worker adapter to general request/context/result; existing claim owner keeps transfer decisions | M2/M3 qualify §5.13 mapping, legacy CLI parity, receiver planning and automatic return; no second note/grant validator |
| Fixed capability-specific recipient list | Current agent discovery plus intelligent responsibility resolution and real authorization checks | M2 covers missing profiles, cross-Goal work and explicit unavailable targets |
| Inline response text doubles as action protocol | Host tool/effect events plus separate saved human answer; legacy decoder only during the migration window | M3 validates interrupted output and effect idempotency, then retires producer use of embedded control text |
| Manager-specific result return pipeline | Channel-neutral committed result/outbox contract; Lark/Web render and acknowledge | M3 proves automatic return and restart reconciliation without a model rerun |

Do not migrate every LoopX subsystem in this program. The refactor slice is manager role, collaboration request/assessment/result and their real adapters. It may remove substantial old code, but does not absorb quota, finance methods or the entire runtime into a new orchestrator. Preserve characterized legitimate behavior while intentionally changing the old restrictions described here; parity tests must not freeze those restrictions as desired behavior.

### 5.10 Minimum contract and legal observations

The following is a **proposed contract**, not an implemented schema or command. M2 finalizes names and serialization, but must preserve these semantics:

```text
WorkRequest {
  request_id, revision, origin_ref, sender_ref, intent,
  target_ref?, authority_ref, context_ref, return_ref,
  work_refs[], supersedes_ref?
}
SemanticContext {
  revision, digest, brief, source_refs[], work_revision_refs[],
  access_scope_ref, omissions[]
}
Observation {
  event_id, request_id, request_revision, actor_ref, event_kind,
  evidence_refs[], result_ref?, recorded_at
}
```

`request_id` identifies the exchange, `revision` is monotonic and immutable once committed, and `origin_ref` resolves to authenticated source provenance. `intent` distinguishes consultation, delegated work and ownership transfer. `target_ref` may be absent only before assignment. The authority reference binds the originating principal's current grant scope; it is resolved independently of the brief. `return_ref` names a principal/audience-scoped result sink or parent request, **not necessarily a manager session**. An empty work-reference list is legal: request acceptance must not require a Todo. `context_ref` resolves to a revision/digest plus the minimal brief: desired outcome, active constraints and known unknowns. Source and work references identify their access scope and known revision; unknown versions are explicit. No raw credential or hidden reasoning is a field.

Validate reference access before presenting context. A summary may be model-authored but retains its sources, authorship and revision; a host validates envelope identity and authority. Oversized context is retained as an access-controlled artifact and a disclosed projection; if it cannot be stored/read, reject with a recoverable context error rather than claim a complete handoff. Existing summaries need no global budget increase.

State is projected from accepted observations along independent axes:

| Axis | Legal evolution and invariant |
| --- | --- |
| Assignment/delivery | unassigned → assigned → inbox-persisted → presented; reassignments create attempt identities; presentation names an actual host turn, not a CLI fetch alone |
| Assessment/work | pending → accepted / partially-accepted / deferred / rejected; accepted work may run and resolve; deferred remains open with a condition; accepted is not completed |
| Control requests | correction / cancellation / expiry are recorded requests or conditions; cancellation becomes effective only at an acknowledged safe boundary, expiry prevents new dispatch but does not undo an in-flight external effect |
| Result delivery | absent → result-committed → pending-send → sent-verified; failed or uncertain sends retain the result; uncertainty requires reconciliation |

Every observation is appended once by event identity with compare-and-set on the request revision. Repeated identical events return the prior receipt; changed payload under that identity conflicts. Core effects return accepted/rejected/conflict/already-applied observations through the existing effect-interpreter seam. Reassignment cannot erase an active execution claim. If the old worker is unreachable, record the uncertainty and preserve the claim until its existing lease/transfer rules permit another executor.

A durable pending request carries a next wake/recheck condition through the existing host scheduling owner. Busy, offline, unsupported delivery, dependency wait and missing input are explicit observations, not repeated model polls. When deferred work becomes eligible, wake or present it once through the supported adapter. A result can be terminal failure/rejection, but incomplete work is not converted into success merely to empty the inbox.

All participants can publish results and inspect their authorized requests; generic collaboration and the outbox do not depend on the manager process. For worker→worker, the return sink can be the originating worker and its parent exchange. The manager is optional synthesis and presentation, not the lifecycle coordinator of every collaboration.

For shell/Git/API effects outside Core, use an effect-intent ID and the provider's idempotency/readback when available. Persist a completion observation only after evidence. A crashed command whose effect is unknown is reconciled before another effectful attempt; lacking an idempotent API is not permission to replay it. The manager's ordinary tools gain freedom, not a false exactly-once guarantee.

### 5.11 Long-horizon continuation as a product contract

A persistent conversation is useful, but work must also survive losing that conversation's executable session. At each supported continuation point, compose the current accepted work state with unresolved request obligations, relevant decisions and changed evidence. Distinguish a dated research conclusion from a current fact. When a correction contradicts an accepted constraint, preserve both revisions and record the receiver's resolution before the affected effect. Do not replay an earlier rejected approach merely because its rejection fell out of the prompt.

Obligation coverage is derived from source requests and receiver assessments, not a second checklist database. The manager identifies the substantive questions; the receiver records which it accepted, deferred or rejected and why, linking current Todo/Vision/evidence where applicable. A result covers those obligations or explicitly leaves a bounded remainder with an owner and resume condition. An acknowledgement, elapsed timer, successful routine invocation or completed subtask cannot silently discharge the whole request. A later session reconstructs that relationship from accepted state and references, without importing runtime-private history.

Artifact continuity is part of semantic continuity. Reuse the artifact owner to carry type, version/digest, resolvable location, access scope and any extraction/summary provenance for relevant images, documents and code. A receiver must obtain the required material or record why it could not. Text-only channels project a readable summary and an authorized artifact link; they do not silently remove evidence or copy a sender-local path as a remote locator. Do not add a mandatory artifact download for questions the brief already answers.

Long-running work must remain legible in the existing conversation: what is being attempted, who owns the next step, what is actually blocking, and what conclusion is owed. Provide expandable tool/artifact activity and current semantic context in the frontend; Lark gets a concise equivalent and actionable results. Distinguish a queued worker, unavailable host, permission refusal, website login and undelivered answer. Do not expose raw protocol envelopes or claim fine-grained tool activity on adapters that cannot supply it.

Reuse existing capability instructions, context hooks, memory and scheduling owners. Reusable methods may inform planning and handoff, with their source/version visible; remembered lessons do not replace accepted task state or current verification. Stable recurring work may use the existing schedule/event path after its task and replay behavior are understood. This RFC does not add a routine engine, compulsory method learning, a new hook family or business-specific automation.

Parallel work does not imply isolated execution resources. Reuse runtime serialization/leases for shared browser screens or mutable workspaces, separately from Core work ownership. Separate screens, agent names or conversation tabs are not permission boundaries. If a runtime lacks the required coordination, serialize the affected operation and expose the wait; unrelated evidence work can continue. M1 reports actual resource behavior rather than assuming a shared cloud-computer design.

### 5.12 Integration with alignment, authority and the TS kernel

**Classify the requested change before selecting its writer.** Consultation can return evidence without a Todo. An in-intent lane correction uses the receiver's existing Vision/Replan/Todo path. A shared dependency or work-graph change that requires an amendment under the alignment contract uses its proposal/admission path; changing shared objective, acceptance, non-goals, permissions or stop conditions never becomes a lane edit merely because the manager requested it. Stage 2 admission has `canonical_effect: none`. Until the corresponding governed commit class is implemented and qualified, retain the proposal and report that precise execution gap; continue unrelated authorized work. Do not invent a manager commit endpoint, peer vote or additional routine human confirmation. Once available, automated amendment uses the qualified Stage 3 `GoalAmendmentAuthority` commit owner's pre-authorized policy/verifier, exact-basis CAS and receipt; peers rebase or receive the specified in-flight-work disposition.

Current amendment admission requires a causal replan obligation and affected Todo IDs. It is not the generic inbox for consultation or pre-Todo work; do not fabricate those records to admit an ordinary request. An adopted handoff separately links actual replan/work settlement. Effect Program, Turn and quota receipts retain their current identities and owners; none becomes a request-completion receipt by aliasing its ID.

**Keep version dimensions distinct.** Carry the request/brief revision and referenced work basis through the existing context/reference model. A work basis identifies Goal intent revision/digest when actually available, source kind and Todo/lease snapshot revision, relevant policy revision, and artifact revisions. Provider generation/cursor, semantic Goal revision, lease epoch and handoff revision are not interchangeable counters. Preserve `unknown`/partial Goal basis rather than inventing a Goal revision from an event sequence or provider head. Before a controlled effect, the owning command revalidates its affected preconditions. A fresh brief cannot revive a stale lease or acknowledge a changed shared goal on another agent's behalf.

**Separate request state from coordination and transport state.** Reuse the existing manager request ledger as the migration source for the general collaboration ledger; it owns intent/assessment/result relations, not copied editable Todos. The shared-authority v0 coordination head remains scoped to its reviewed Todo/claim/lease/gate/receipt semantics. Conversation and semantic brief bodies, raw artifacts, transport attempts and scheduler cursors remain with their existing capability/artifact/adapter owners. Use scoped references between them. Do not add these families to a generic `next_projection` merely because the store accepts JSON. Physical storage may be shared only with independent namespaces, access/retention contracts and reviewed schema compatibility. No provider deployment is required to introduce the request contract.

**Commit within each actual authority boundary; reconcile across boundaries.** A request transition and its own receipt must publish atomically under its owning transaction. A Todo/lease mutation retains its existing lock or promoted authority's state/event/receipt CAS. If adoption also updates work state, persist the effect intent, call that owner, and link its exact receipt; a crash between the two commits leaves a recoverable pending relation. It must not manufacture an atomic request-plus-Todo commit across independent stores. Cross-Goal handoff likewise carries each Goal's basis and receipts, with explicit partial outcomes, not a distributed transaction or shared synthetic revision. Use the existing effect-interpreter, journals and recovery paths; no new workflow engine is required.

**Honor the selected source per Goal.** Before promotion, existing legacy commands remain the writer. After promotion, call the selected canonical authority; an empty result stays empty and provider failure never falls back to stale Markdown or lease files. Markdown remains a permanent readable projection, not a retired UI or a second writer. SSH transport reachability is independent of shared-provider adoption. A received message grants neither a fresh claim nor authority to compute through an expired fence. Authorized independent reads may continue during a provider outage; controlled writes obey the authority contract.

**Migrate a whole semantic transaction.** Follow TS T0–T3 for each changed public path: one current source snapshot, typed validation/decision, owned effect and durable result, then adapter projection. Reuse `AuthorityStore` and transaction decoding only where that contract actually applies; do not reuse its Todo aggregate as a catch-all. Do not add Python→TS calls per handoff field, retain Python validators as a second policy, or restore retired facades. Implementation PRs include the **migration economics receipt** defined by [TS §5](typescript-control-plane-migration-v0.md#5-payoff-phase-pr-contract). The implementing PR author owns this review artifact in the PR description and validation comment, pinned to base/head; it is not a persisted product receipt, new schema or runtime writer. Its fields cover old/new owner, semantic code deleted, bridge code, happy/recovery round trips, net product code, remaining callers and removal conditions. Full legacy writer retirement waits for the applicable T4/D3 conditions; replacing a manager request writer does not authorize a Goal-wide cutover.

### 5.13 Integrate shipped explicit continuation (#4094)

[Stage A](cross-session-memory-substrate-v0.md), merged in [#4094](https://github.com/huangruiteng/loopx/pull/4094) as `2ebd921ee989f7c696a7214ba1176d3bd5de6fb3`, is an implementation foundation and an in-scope refactor input. Despite the historical RFC filename, it deliberately replaced the generic memory-substrate proposal with `loopx handoff prepare/inspect/adopt`: explicit local continuation over current Todo authority. Do not resurrect a separate memory ledger, redo the shipped primitive or count its merge as completion of M2.

**Reuse its semantic content without duplicating work truth.** Source rationale, rejected approaches and open questions are precisely the non-reconstructable context a long-horizon receiver needs. Preserve the rich and legacy forms through a versioned mapping:

| Stage A content | General collaboration use |
| --- | --- |
| `work_summary`, `rationale`, `key_decisions`, `approaches_tried` | Source-authored brief and decision/attempt history, with provenance; never replace the receiver's current work assessment |
| `next_steps`, `open_questions` | Source suggestions and unresolved questions; receiver assesses them against actual obligations and its plan, without automatic priority or acceptance changes |
| `files_touched`, `source_refs` | Scoped artifact references; local existence is not verified content, and a source path is not a cross-host locator |
| Todo identity/facts, provider revision, note marker/fingerprint, source session | Current work/authority references and provenance; retain their distinct meaning rather than turn them into one request revision or authentication token |

Stage A replaces the current Todo note; it does not provide immutable historical versions or a private memory ACL. Existing notes inherit Todo visibility. Execution-fact changes, including ownership transfer, invalidate the old note; a captured historical brief remains source evidence, not a currently valid transfer grant. During migration, retain the original note/current-state relationship and its real update/claim receipts. If an exchange needs a brief that survives later note replacement, capture the authorized source content as a versioned collaboration/artifact reference at ingress, with the original revision/digest and scope; keep current work facts as references. An old overwritten note cannot be reconstructed by invention. Before retiring or changing the note representation, qualify old/new validation and grant behavior together, keep exactly one writer for each object, and preserve legacy callers until their replacement passes. This does not enlarge the shared-authority coordination head or automatically permit broader disclosure of existing notes.

**Separate receiver assessment from ownership adoption.** `Assessment.adopted` means the receiver accepted a scope; Stage A `handoff adopt` invokes a Todo claim/transfer. Consultation and ordinary delegation need no ownership transfer. For an explicit transfer intent, reuse `continuation_note.ts`, current note/fact validation, `todo_transfer_grant_v0` and the existing claim owner. The typed grant binds source/target/Todo/revision/note facts; a note, digest, registered identity or message by itself is not an execution grant. Stop the old executor before the new one continues through the supported runtime boundary; a transfer receipt alone cannot stop a running process. Stage A session IDs remain provenance, not authentication or a runtime lease. Its hard-lease, host and source-selection restrictions remain attached to this adapter until a separately qualified owning path supports expansion, not universal restrictions on all requests.

**M2/M3 deliver the product bridge.** Preserve the public CLI and digest path while introducing ordinary manager/worker invocation of the same typed effects. The owner should be able to ask “let the other agent continue, preserving the failed approach and my correction” without manually exporting JSON or repeatedly approving an already authorized request. Expose prepared context, actual receiver assessment, Todo ownership readback and result delivery as distinct facts in existing frontend/Lark views. Automatic presentation/start, cross-host artifact resolution and automatic return are integration work, not capabilities already shipped by #4094. Frontend or Lark text must not mint a transfer grant.

Qualify worker→worker through this adapter as the concrete second M2 consumer **only after** it consumes the general request/context and emits the shared assessment/result/return relations. A standalone `adopt` success is insufficient. Reuse the Stage A real CLI fixtures for context readback, stale note/revision, lease rejection, unavailable artifacts, ordinary foreign-owner claim rejection, operation replay and uncertain-write recovery. Keep context separate from action/actor/target/revision fields: operational-key collisions and scalar/array roots fail before mutation, with revision/note/owner/receipts unchanged. Add A5/A7/A13–A16 integration cases: a rejected approach plus correction changes receiver planning; historical replay does not prove current ownership; the final conclusion returns without a manager-only dependency. Retiring the old caller requires this evidence and the TS §5 review artifact; no new generic continuation framework is a prerequisite.

## 6. Alternatives and disposition of #4306

- **Choose normal runtime tools + LoopX semantic state.** It preserves agent flexibility and reuses existing tooling. Its cost is real host-profile qualification and clear private/shared-scope isolation.
- **Do not make a growing list of dedicated evidence tools the primary manager design.** #4306 solves real revision, coverage and routing problems, but its special GitHub reader duplicates mature tools while leaving the restrictive manager shape intact. Close that PR as the default-path solution. Keep its regression cases for revision drift, unavailable sources, responsible routing and private-scope leakage; port only cases exercised by the replacement path.
- **Retain optional bounded readers where the environment needs them.** A shared group, remote read-only service or minimal host can use the existing portfolio reader or a connector. This does not justify forcing the trusted local owner through it.
- **Reject pure prompt expansion and raw-message forwarding as sufficient fixes.** They cannot establish delivery, preserve all referenced context or commit state safely.
- **Reject a new universal workflow/state database.** Replace fragmented handoff owners with one typed collaboration context, referencing existing work authority. Qualify it with manager→worker and worker→worker on the same conformance tests; do not retain a manager-only architecture by default.

Closing #4306 does not close its underlying user problem. Its issue remains linked to M1/M2 until direct investigation and responsibility routing pass live acceptance. No new protocol is justified solely by having written a large RFC.

## 7. Safety, privacy and compatibility

The trust boundary is principal/resource/effect/audience, not “Lark is always untrusted” or “same machine means everything is public.” High autonomy is valuable only with an enforceable host profile. Keep credentials in the existing runtime store and raw private source material outside public projections. Untrusted repository/web content is data; it cannot update standing grants or manager instructions.

Version semantic briefs and reference manifests. Preserve existing stored fields and unknown historical facts; no synthetic read/adoption times. A correction does not rewrite an old conclusion. A fresh conclusion may supersede one with an explicit link. Permission revocation prevents new use/disclosure and invalidates incompatible conversation context, while retaining access-controlled audit records.

Feature-off/restricted-mode behavior stays testable. Existing grants are migrated by exact semantics, never widened by “manager enabled.” Revocation, provider errors and missing host features produce concrete repair guidance. Routine read failures should not block unrelated authorized work.

## 8. Migration and rollback

1. Inventory current runtime/profile, session mapping, grants, pending inbox entries and outbox deliveries. Establish baseline journey fixtures before changes.
2. Introduce the capable manager profile through existing configuration ownership; promote for trusted owners only after effective-permission readback. Reuse a sufficient existing grant; request a one-time profile decision only if no such grant exists. Retain an explicit restricted profile.
3. Introduce the general collaboration contract and map existing manager and same-Goal handoff records losslessly; keep old readers during a bounded migration window. Legacy records expose missing semantic context as unknown and remain readable/deliverable. New producers must not require unsupported receivers; negotiate or render a compatible semantic brief without dropping obligations.
4. Move shared lifecycle transitions into the established typed owner with characterization/parity tests. Keep Python/provider code as adapters. Shared database adoption is a separate project, not a prerequisite.
5. Quiesce only the affected dispatch lane before switching its single writer. Reconcile committed requests/results before activation. Preserve source IDs, pending state and old-reader snapshots.
6. Roll back the runtime profile independently from handoff delivery. Disable new writes before returning to an older schema reader; drain/export incompatible records rather than silently losing fields or replaying work. Report unsupported downgrade explicitly.

### Required legacy mapping

M0 inventories actual fields and producers; the following mapping is the migration acceptance floor, not evidence that a migrator exists:

| Legacy record family | New meaning / preservation rule |
| --- | --- |
| Ingress and manager entries | Preserve source/request IDs, original text, digests, sender, target and exact return scope; introduce a deterministic migration alias, never redispatch |
| Read/decision records | Preserve original times and `adopt/defer/reject/no_change`; map reads to context-provided unless a host-turn receipt exists; preserve `no_change` as a decision, not failed work |
| Todo/evidence links | Preserve all links and source revisions; absent Todo remains legal; a link alone does not verify an artifact |
| Conclusions and return receipts | Preserve immutable audience-ready text, phase, identity, send attempts and ambiguous/pending outcomes; do not re-emit verified sends |
| Pending #4312-style peer records | Preserve the original tuple-derived dispatch identity as a legacy alias and its claim receipts; new rounds use new request IDs, not that old tuple |
| Unrecognized stored fields | Preserve access-controlled legacy payload plus its digest; explicitly map before dropping any field; unknown history is never fabricated |

Run old/new read-model comparison over synthetic records in every lifecycle state, including no-change, partial/legacy unknown, crash-after-effect and scope revocation. During cutover one writer owns each request; old readers are compatibility projections, not parallel authorities. A restore must reconcile outbox/claims and preserve newer records before switching back. Rollback cannot undo external effects.

## 9. Validation and acceptance

The following IDs are durable acceptance anchors for engineering Todos and PRs. They define future tests; this RFC does not mark them passed.

| ID | Journey / required evidence | Pass condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | Owner asks about a real local repository and remote PR | Manager independently reads normal tools, pins actual revision and gives an evidence-backed answer without a special PR provider |
| A2 | Local cache unavailable; alternate permitted source works | Manager completes the investigation; real denial is reported accurately and not circumvented |
| A3 | One persistent grant, two requests and a runtime restart | Permitted work proceeds without repeat approval; revoked/out-of-scope actions do not |
| A4 | Active worker absent from convenience routing profile | Current registered responsibility is discovered; correct authorized receiver selected; stopped targets remain excluded |
| A5 | Three linked user messages including a correction and prior rejected approach | Receiver explains the intended change, preserved constraints and actual Todo/Vision consequence without asking the user to retype context |
| A6 | Manager→worker and worker→worker run the same handoff fixture | Same identity, revision, assessment, state links and return semantics, including cross-Goal consultation without an initial Todo and a second review round of one Todo; no second task database |
| A7 | Duplicate ingress, correction/cancellation during execution, concurrent claim, repeated same-Todo review and crash after a non-Core effect | No duplicate accepted effect; revision conflict is reconciled; no silent priority/ownership override |
| A8 | Worker finishes while manager/transport restarts | Result survives; original audience receives it automatically; ambiguous send is reconciled, not blindly repeated |
| A9 | Long response and truncated protocol trailer | Full valid answer is preserved and recoverable; no leaked protocol, lost obligation or replayed action |
| A10 | Owner frontend and authorized Lark conversation | Consistent request facts; truthful queued/assessed/resolved/delivery states; different audiences remain isolated |
| A11 | Registered SSH host unavailable or older receiver | Coverage and pending route are explicit; local mentions do not pretend to be remote evidence; recovery resumes correctly |
| A12 | Model/session/tool-profile upgrade | Compatible session resumes; incompatible recovery preserves constraints and pending requests; effective configuration is visible |
| A13 | Work spans two days; replace the executable session after an accepted plan, a rejected approach and a later correction | Receiver reconstructs current commitments and unresolved obligations from canonical state/context; refreshes time-sensitive evidence; explains its actual plan delta and returns the owed conclusion without silently reviving the rejected path or requiring the original transcript |
| A14 | Handoff includes a relevant image/document and reaches a different configured host through a text-only channel | Receiver observation ties actual read/extraction to the artifact revision and its effect on obligations/plan, or gives an explicit no-read reason; no false read receipt, private disclosure or sender-local-path assumption |
| A15 | Same handoff fixture against unpromoted and explicitly configured promoted Goal sources; provider outage and crash between request/work commits | Exactly one selected work-state writer; no fallback on canonical empty/failure; original work receipt is recovered and linked without duplicate effects; a pending request relation remains distinguishable from a committed work change |
| A16 | Receiver lane replan versus shared amendment, stale basis and peer-held work | Lane edits stay inside intent and authority; proposal admission changes no Goal; unsupported commit is explicit; a supported amendment requires the qualified Stage 3 `GoalAmendmentAuthority` commit owner's exact receipt and peer rebase/lease disposition, never just manager or verifier prose |

Run deterministic transition/compatibility tests, real installed-runtime qualification, then real frontend/Lark roundtrips with synthetic safe tasks and an authorized private canary. Record runtime/source versions and emitted receipts. Include mobile Lark and packaged frontend render/readback; backend tests alone do not pass A10. Provider receipt ambiguity and offline failure cases are required, not optional happy-path add-ons.

## 10. Operational contract

Measure ingress acknowledgement latency, first substantive response, handoff assessment latency, result-to-delivery latency, repeated-confirmation rate, unresolved requests and incorrect routing. Report attempted/verified/omitted source coverage and configured/effective permissions. Do not reward message counts or queue movement as completed work.

Target an ingress receipt within two seconds on a healthy local service, independently of model latency; this is an initial SLO to measure, not a model-response promise. Long work announces an actionable delay rather than emitting periodic noise. Cap model concurrency and per-turn investigation cost through existing runtime/Goal configuration; the manager's budget must not consume all worker capacity. Busy workers retain accepted work; queuing and next wake are visible.

Use existing service recovery and receipt pumps. No manager-specific business automation for each kind of request. Expose configuration and failures through the existing CLI, capability settings and manager conversation. Troubleshooting distinguishes model failure, tool/policy denial, state conflict, unreachable receiver and transport formatting/delivery failure.

## 11. Normative delivery plan

Implement coherent end-to-end slices, not one PR per incidental field. The manager engineering owner maintains canonical Todos and a private incident-to-acceptance map; PRs link this RFC milestone and acceptance IDs. Public progress updates contain only safe results. Milestone completion requires current deployment evidence, not merged PR count.

| Milestone | Shipped behavior and ownership | Entry / exit evidence | Rollback |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M0 — reconcile direction | Manager capability owner inventories current restrictions, grants, sessions and pending exchanges; closes superseded #4306 path and maps surviving fixes | Existing fixtures + public decision link + no orphaned request; no runtime claim | Documentation/proposal only |
| M1 — useful host agent | Manager capability + runtime adapter use ordinary tools/skills and persistent owner grant; frontend exposes effective profile/session, supported tool activity and actionable failures | A1–A3, A12 on real installed runtime; qualify shared-resource coordination; portfolio remains reusable; no per-resource wrapper required | Restore restricted profile, preserve requests |
| M2 — semantic continuation | Core collaboration replaces manager-specific request transitions; reuses alignment and selected work authority; supports pre-Todo/cross-Goal requests and receiver planning; both consumers qualify the same contract | A4–A7, A11, A13–A16 at the supported boundary; old/new parity and crash reconciliation; TS migration economics review artifact (§5.12) | Disable new producer, retain compatible readers and pending results; do not switch Goal authority |
| M3 — automatic complete exchange | Receiver conclusion + existing outbox + frontend/Lark visibility, safe rich output and restart recovery | A8–A10 plus A13–A14 return-path qualification; failure injection and live readback; user receives conclusion without querying | Keep result store, switch transport/profile without replay |
| M4 — promotion and retirement | Three heterogeneous active Goals, owner + shared-scope and configured SSH journeys pass; obsolete manager restrictions/compatibility seams removed | All acceptance rows, permission regression and measured SLO/cost; document remaining unqualified hosts | Scoped rollback with schema-aware drain/export |

M1 need not wait for a generic handoff refactor. M3's independent format/delivery fixes may ship early using the existing inbox. M2 promotion needs the second consumer; it must not hold a useful manager-only improvement hostage. No milestone creates an extra user confirmation for routine research or normal delegation.

Each implementation Todo declares target capability, repository, write scope, validation command, RFC milestone, acceptance IDs and dependencies. Prefer extending existing Todos; supersede obsolete ones with lineage. Separate LoopX core transition work, manager capability/runtime work, frontend/Lark work and domain-adapter work. Domain recipes remain outside this generic RFC. The engineering owner reports the accepted scope and next milestone, then the delivered outcome and evidence automatically.

### 11.1 Dependency and parallel-work plan

| Slice | Hard prerequisite | Can proceed without | Completion boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M1 host agent and early M3 reply recovery | Current runtime, effective authority/profile, existing UI/transport contracts | Generic collaboration replacement, shared provider promotion, amendment Stage 3, full TS rewrite | Native tool and feedback journeys; no changes to Goal truth or provider defaults |
| M2 request transaction replacement | TS T0 caller/source inventory within the implementation PR; characterized current request/receipt behavior; one writer and lossless migration | A new daemon, PostgreSQL service, D3 cutover, shared Goal amendments | Request identity/assessment/result in one typed domain; old request writer retired at the bounded cutover; unchanged external work owners |
| M2 receiver and authority integration | Existing alignment/admission and current Todo/Vision/lease commands; request effect/recovery seam; each affected command's supported transaction contract | Closing unrelated T1/T2/T3 consumers or promoting every provider | A15 on disposable legacy/canonical fixtures; A16 proves lane/admission boundaries; unsupported work effects remain explicit |
| M3 complete exchange | Committed result and exact request/work receipt relationships; supported runtime and Lark/frontend adapters | M2 completion for independent format/retry fixes | Generic producer integration follows M2; early fixes preserve the existing owner and cannot claim the new schema shipped |
| Governed shared-amendment integration | Alignment Stage 3's qualified commit class, policy/verifier, lease impact and exact-basis receipt | Unrelated manager UX improvements | Conditional follow-up owned jointly with alignment; no implementation of a second `GoalAmendmentAuthority` |
| M4 manager promotion | Qualified M1–M3 and A1–A16 for advertised profiles, including unsupported-amendment negative cases | Provider-wide migration, ten-day storage soak for an unchanged existing profile, or a PostgreSQL rollout | Promote only manager/handoff behavior. New storage/default/shared-amendment capabilities retain their separate gates |

If this program changes a provider, retention or authority-source profile, its affected D1/D2/D3 requirements become hard dependencies; manager acceptance cannot waive the required ten-day soak or cutover approval. A13's continuation test and D2's storage soak measure different things. An existing profile used unchanged does not acquire a new ten-day gate merely because a manager reads it.

### 11.2 Execution order and integration receipts

1. **Start M1; finish baseline reconciliation in that PR.** Record the exact source head and actual runtime/entrypoint call sites. Fix the owner-private profile and existing readback/feedback. Run A1–A3/A12. Do not deliver a standalone inventory framework.
2. **Replace one complete M2 request transaction, then attach receivers.** Begin from `manager_context` request/tracking/return producers and both real consumers, including the shipped #4094 CLI continuation adapter (§5.13). Publish the before/after ownership map, migration mapping and the migration economics review artifact (§5.12). Preserve accepted work state through existing commands; qualify crash-between-commits and legacy/promoted sources before widening producer rollout. Use existing alignment source-basis reads, not a copied classifier.
3. **Close M3 automatic return and user visibility.** Independent reply recovery can ship in parallel with steps 1–2. Integrate the generic producer only after its receipt contract is stable; exercise A8–A10 and A13–A16 across the actual entrance/receiver/return paths. Update packaged frontend, Lark and CLI from the same projection.
4. **Promote a named M4 cohort and remove the replaced paths.** Keep provider default, Goal-intent authority and capability qualifications explicit. Shared-amendment commit integration follows its upstream readiness; until then the UI says proposal/admission or unsupported commit, never “Goal changed.” Provider source migration follows the shared-authority program rather than this release.

At every PR handoff, report: base/head; this RFC's milestone/acceptance IDs; relevant TS T-card and authority D-card if affected; alignment stage consumed; exact owner/command/receipt and source mode; callers deleted; tests/real-runtime evidence; unresolved holds; and one next executable step. Link the existing canonical engineering Todos rather than copying a live task list into this document. If upstream ownership moves, resolve the new symbol and update both language versions before implementing; do not restore the old module just to satisfy this plan.

## 12. Open decisions

1. **Trusted-host profile defaults:** maintainers own promotion. Recommend using the effective owner runtime profile with explicit resource/audience binding, not a new manager ACL language. Before M1, qualify actual read/write/network/approval behavior and migration from existing grants.
2. **Generic handoff API placement:** typed control-plane and manager capability owners map existing storage/transactions before M2. Recommend one coherent TypeScript collaboration boundary replacing manager-specific handoff ownership; exact type/module names and the lossless storage mapping follow characterization, not this prose.
3. **Delivery SLOs and context budgets:** manager engineering owner measures M1/M3 latency and constraint retention. Keep current budgets until evidence shows a specific bottleneck; amend both language versions for normative changes.

These are engineering decisions to resolve within authorized scope and record in review; they are not new routine owner gates. Permission expansion and incompatible migration still require their actual existing authority.

## Appendix A: Research and decision basis

- [Server-client product shape](../../product/foundations/server-client-product-shape.md): LoopX is durable work authority; executor intelligence and runtime tools remain outside the store. This RFC changes the manager's restrictive role, not that separation.
- [Agent-loop effect interpreter](agent-loop-effect-interpreter-v0.md): every interpreted effect returns an observation. Handoff and return should fit that loop, rather than grow disconnected task states.
- [Agent IM collaboration](agent-im-openviking-collaboration-v0.md), [Shared authority](shared-goal-authority-state-provider-v0.md): transport, context and state authority differ; a stronger local manager does not require promoting a remote state provider.
- [Codex App Server architecture](https://openai.com/index/unlocking-the-codex-harness/): the runtime already supplies tools, skills, durable threads and streamed events. Reuse it as the host rather than recreate those capabilities in manager-only APIs.
- [A2A specification](https://a2a-protocol.org/dev/specification/): message/context/task, status and artifacts are useful comparison concepts. This RFC borrows the separation of communication and work outcomes, not an A2A dependency or a new transport mandate. The linked development specification is not pinned implementation authority.

The external sources inform the design; they do not prove LoopX behavior. The named LoopX baseline and its source paths support Section 4. Private incident transcripts and account information are excluded.

## Appendix B: Decision and execution ledger

2026-09-13: proposed a capable manager plus semantic continuation direction and a substantial collaboration-boundary refactor. [#4306 was closed](https://github.com/huangruiteng/loopx/pull/4306#issuecomment-5652539392) as the superseded implementation path; its underlying issue remains an M1/M2 acceptance obligation. Existing reply-recovery and responsibility-discovery fixes remain useful. No acceptance row, host-profile promotion or handoff schema migration is claimed delivered by this document.

2026-09-13: added the official Grok Bot study in Appendix C; refined positioning, Section 5.11, A13–A14 and M1–M3. This adds reviewable requirements, not a competitor runtime qualification or shipped LoopX behavior.

2026-09-13: reconciled shared-authority, shared-alignment and TS migration progress at the pinned baseline; added Sections 4.1–4.2, 5.12 and 11.1–11.2 plus A15–A16. Updated the companion RFCs and index, retained separate promotion/commit owners, and sharpened A13 elapsed-time and A14 actual-use evidence. No upstream qualification hold is waived.

Record future decisions as dated links to reviewed changes, naming the normative sections affected. Preserve previous source revisions and unresolved requests. Do not turn an append-only delivery log into an alternate task authority.

## Appendix C: Grok Bot product and implementation study

### C.1 Method and evidence boundary

Reviewed official product, usage and deployment documentation on **2026-09-13**. This is a documentation study, not an authenticated product trial, performance benchmark or source audit of the Grok Bot runtime. The sources below identify what is advertised or documented; LoopX decisions are ours. A missing public guarantee is **unknown**, not proof of an absent implementation.

Do not substitute Grok's model/API capabilities, the X reply bot, Grok Build source code or another coding agent's internals for Grok Bot evidence. The current Bot documentation references Cursor-hosted infrastructure and account services; those are documented deployment details, not grounds to infer a shared scheduler, model routing algorithm or transaction implementation.

### C.2 What is documented, and what it establishes

| Surface | Officially documented behavior / mechanism | Evidence limit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Product promise | The [launch announcement](https://x.ai/news/introducing-grok-bot) presents background agents and a coordinating chief-of-staff role. The [overview](https://docs.x.ai/grok-bot/overview) describes persistent working context and work continuing while the client is closed. | Supports an always-available product model; neither a testimonial nor background execution proves goal acceptance across arbitrary interruptions. |
| Role and memory | [Bots](https://docs.x.ai/grok-bot/bots) have named roles, separate conversations and learned context. Profiles hold stable responsibilities; memory includes preferences/facts/summaries. Changing facts should be checked at their source. Copying a profile does not copy its conversation or learned memory. | Profile, memory and durable task authority are different concepts. The memory algorithm and consistency guarantees are not disclosed here. |
| Conversation and collaboration | [Chat and collaboration](https://docs.x.ai/grok-bot/chat-and-collaboration) documents groups, directed mentions, threads, reactions and asynchronous Bot messages that wake a recipient for a later reply. Bot-to-group handoffs are text-only. | A visible reply is useful UX; the page does not specify revision conflicts, accepted work ownership or a durable return-obligation protocol. |
| Execution substrate | [Computer and apps](https://docs.x.ai/grok-bot/computer-and-apps) describes one persistent account computer, shared files/logins and separate Bot screens; one computer-use task per screen. Connectors are preferred where suitable, with browser interaction for other workflows. Local-computer execution is separately controlled. | Screens are not security isolation. The docs expose resource behavior, not the locking implementation or complete agent loop. |
| Results | [Files and results](https://docs.x.ai/grok-bot/files-and-results) supports attachments and reviewable artifacts, with shared workspace access. It recommends distinguishing facts, inference, completed work, pending actions and open questions. | An artifact or screenshot is not by itself proof of a completed external action or a current source read. |
| Reusable work | [Skills and routines](https://docs.x.ai/grok-bot/skills-routines-and-automations) describes reusable instructions, task demonstrations that draft skills, and a Bot-owned schedule/event routine with run history. Testing a routine can perform real work. | This explains workflow reuse and triggering; it does not specify LoopX-style goal convergence, semantic adoption or external-effect idempotency. |
| Permission experience | [Approvals and privacy](https://docs.x.ai/grok-bot/approvals-security-and-privacy) describes operation-specific approval, matching persistent rules, and separate local-execution controls. A matching allow rule does not override a conflicting required review. | Useful permission UX; it is not a reason to add repeated confirmations to already-authorized LoopX work. |
| Deployment boundaries | [Security](https://docs.x.ai/grok-bot/security) describes hosted computers, an action-review model, user-attributed access, backend-held connector tokens, and independent network/connector controls. Its logging and recording surfaces have distinct coverage. | These are public implementation boundaries, not a complete threat model or evidence of transaction semantics. No particular model or isolation strategy is imported into LoopX. |
| Identity | [Identity and access](https://docs.x.ai/grok-bot/identity-and-access) distinguishes product sign-in, application browser sessions and connector authentication. | Authentication to one layer does not establish access at another. The runtime's real identity remains necessary when resolving a handoff. |
| Recovery | [Troubleshooting](https://docs.x.ai/grok-bot/troubleshooting) separates client, computer, routine, permission and login failures. Recovery/update can preserve durable state; reset may lose unsynced work. | Persistent storage is not an exactly-once guarantee. Recovery outcomes must be qualified independently. |

### C.3 Implementation reading: compose existing mechanisms, do not infer hidden ones

The documented product can be understood through four observable boundaries: **role/conversation**, **computer/tools**, **collaboration/triggering**, and **results/recovery**. This is our decomposition, not a claim about Grok Bot source modules. Our untested design hypothesis is that a usable computer, existing tools and visible progress help a strong agent investigate beyond a small snapshot without a custom reader for every resource; no comparative performance result is claimed.

The [Grok Bot 101 guide](https://x.ai/bot/guides/grok-bot-101) illustrates gathering context and asking a Cursor cloud agent to implement software. That is a documented outer/inner workflow example, not evidence that the Bot runtime is implemented by that coding agent. For LoopX, the useful idea is to give the receiver a meaningful job with enough context; the accepted work and return contract should survive changing the executor.

The reviewed sources do not establish Bot queue storage, acknowledgement transactions, crash-after-effect reconciliation, handoff schema, memory summarization algorithm or cancellation races. We must not claim these features absent, copy an imagined design, or report a source-level implementation comparison. A future authorized trial can test those behaviors, but is not a prerequisite for fixing our already-observed manager restrictions.

### C.4 Always available versus long-horizon

| Property | Always-available agent | LoopX long-horizon contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Availability | Can receive work later and retain an identity | Continues the accepted goal through the host's supported wake/resume path; offline and unsupported paths remain explicit |
| State | May retain conversation, preferences and files | Preserves objective, acceptance, current plan, commitments, decisions, evidence and unresolved gaps as related work state |
| Progress | May run background steps or repeat a routine; availability alone says nothing about goal convergence | Selects useful next work, verifies outcomes and replans against the goal; a wake or successful invocation is not progress |
| Collaboration | Can message another agent and obtain a reply | Carries decision-relevant context; receiver assesses impact on its own plan; remaining obligations and return are recoverable |
| Replacement | A service or profile may restart | A supported replacement executor reconstructs accepted work without copying the old runtime's private session database |
| Completion | Can answer or stop | Distinguishes task result, goal acceptance and delivered conclusion; leaves a traceable continuation when incomplete |

The right-hand column is LoopX's design contract, grounded in its existing Goal/Vision/Todo/effect foundations and extended by this RFC. It does **not** assert that every adapter already passes these requirements. Making each connected agent long-horizon requires qualifying that adapter's observation, wake, context and writeback paths. Nor does the left-hand column cap Grok Bot's capabilities: the distinction is conceptual; its documented persistence alone is insufficient evidence for the right-hand guarantees.

### C.5 Limited borrowing and deliberate differences

Borrow three product patterns: a stable capable role with ordinary tools; visible asynchronous coordination with a clear next owner; and reviewable results plus actionable recovery. Apply them through the existing manager, runtime and frontend/Lark paths. Do not clone another chat product, force a shared logged-in cloud computer, add a competing routine scheduler or treat model memory as canonical work state.

Preserve the LoopX-specific combination: strong executor freedom **and** dense, explicit work semantics. A semantic handoff is neither a huge transcript nor a fixed task queue item. It connects an intent and its corrections to current commitments, supporting evidence, rejected alternatives, acceptance and the owed return. That context lets an agent reconsider the plan intelligently without forgetting the goal or silently overriding another agent's commitments.

| Research consequence | RFC / implementation consequence | Qualification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A capable role needs actual tools and understandable feedback | M1, Sections 5.1/5.3/5.11: normal host profile, effective readback, visible tool activity and accurate block diagnosis | A1–A3/A12; existing packaged frontend and Lark feedback |
| Asynchronous communication alone does not define accepted work | M2, Sections 5.4–5.6: one collaboration owner, semantic brief, receiver assessment, current state relations | A5–A7/A13; manager→worker and worker→worker |
| Useful evidence may not fit a text message or survive a host change | M2/M3, Section 5.11: authorized resolvable artifacts, extraction provenance and explicit omissions | A14, including unavailable/denied artifact cases |
| A background job still owes an understandable result | M3, Sections 5.6/5.7: committed conclusion, independent delivery and preserved remainder | A8–A10/A13; restart and malformed-output injection |
| Long-horizon is an end-to-end property of agent plus control loop | M4: qualify goal continuation across runtime replacement and evidence change, alongside permission and cost checks | A1–A16; no promotion based solely on a live process, routine or merged PR |

For A13, injected-clock tests qualify deterministic time-sensitive continuation. M4's cross-day claim additionally needs an installed-runtime run with a real interruption and at least 24 hours between recorded checkpoints; report elapsed time and versions separately. A same-day run proves only the narrower restart fixture. This is not the shared-authority D2 ten-day storage soak. A14 uses a synthetic public-safe image/document with a known decision-relevant fact, so its receiver observation proves use or a justified omission without publishing private material. Competitive scoring or a Grok Bot login is not required to deliver these LoopX improvements.
