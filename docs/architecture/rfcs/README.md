# Architecture RFCs

Architecture RFCs are public design proposals. Each RFC should name its
decision boundary, non-goals, smallest useful implementation slice, and
validation criteria. An RFC may describe future work; current behavior is
defined by the implementation and stable reference contracts.

Start new proposals from the [RFC template](TEMPLATE.md). Existing RFCs should
adopt its maintenance contract when substantial revision would otherwise mix
stable design, current progress, and historical evidence.

The [Current Technical Directions](../../project/technical-directions.md) page
maps RFCs to strategic programs, contribution routes, and promotion gates.

## How to read this index

The sections below are technical ownership areas, not maturity levels. Each
primary RFC appears once under its nearest architectural owner even when it
also affects other areas.

Within each entry, RFC maturity and delivery maturity remain separate facts:

- **RFC status** records the decision state written in the RFC. `Draft` work
  remains open to architectural change even when a bounded slice has shipped.
- **Delivery on `main`** records the implementation state audited against the
  repository. A merged experiment does not make its whole RFC accepted, and an
  accepted RFC may still have later adoption work.
- **Current boundary** names what is real now and what is still excluded. It is
  a navigation aid, not a replacement for stable protocol documentation.

Within an RFC, keep the same separation:

- normative sections define the current decision and acceptance contract;
- a dated execution ledger records shipped slices and experiments without
  silently changing that contract;
- a decision log records explicit approval and the sections it changed;
- an evidence registry maps claims to reproducible, public-safe proof.

Do not append progress reports to a normative delivery plan. Move long ledgers
to a linked `*-execution.md` companion. Schema reduction is never an incidental
cleanup: the RFC or PR must name each removed field, document producer/reader/
writer and compatibility research, define migration and rollback, prove the
claimed semantic equivalence, and record explicit maintainer approval.

This index was last audited against `main` on **2026-09-04**. Update an entry
whenever its RFC status, promoted behavior, or meaningful delivery boundary
changes.
