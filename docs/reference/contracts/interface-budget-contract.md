# Interface Budget Contract

LoopX keeps hot-path worker surfaces small enough that a short heartbeat
can route work without reading raw run history or long chat context. This is a
restraint contract, not an encouragement to add more state surfaces. Each
surface below has a single owner, a named consumer action, a cold-path fallback,
and size/count budgets.

| Surface | Owner | Consumer Action | Cold Path | Size Budget | Nested Budget | Count Budget |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `heartbeat_prompt_json` | heartbeat automation | wake and route one bounded turn | `quota should-run`, `status`, or `review-packet --handoff-only` | `json_chars <= 4800` plus `interface_budget.within_budget=true` | `nested_keys <= 40` | `top_level_keys <= 30` |
| `review_packet_handoff_only_json` | project-agent handoff | forward the smallest sufficient task packet | full `review-packet` or run-history artifact | `json_chars <= 3000` plus `handoff_interface_budget.within_budget=true` | `nested_keys <= 40` | `top_level_keys <= 18` |
| `quota_should_run_json` | quota guard | decide whether the selected goal may spend compute | `status`, `history`, or active state | `json_chars <= 13000` | `nested_keys <= 330` | `top_level_keys <= 52` |
| `dashboard_status_json` | operator dashboard | render first-screen operator state | `history`, run artifacts, or project-local adapter output | `json_chars <= 19500` | `nested_keys <= 260` | `top_level_keys <= 25` |

These four budgets measure compact machine payloads. For
`heartbeat_prompt_json`, the measured payload is the actual
`heartbeat_agent_input_v1` projection emitted by the recurring-host
`heartbeat-prompt --thin --format json` path, not the richer internal
generator payload. Visible one-shot Goal hosts retain their host-specific
activation packet. The other payloads are measured before stdout formatting. JSON
indentation and Markdown wrappers can make emitted output materially larger;
the emitted-output qualification matrix below measures that separate boundary
through the real CLI entry point.

The successful thin heartbeat projection contains only `schema_version`,
`ok`, `goal_id`, optional `agent_id`, `task_body`, and the compact
`interface_budget`; exact Turn identity and `bootstrap=true` are included only
when requested. Generator provenance, resolved paths, mode booleans, policy
source strings, runtime diagnostics, and command copies already embedded in
`task_body` stay out of the Agent input. A failed projection contains the
schema, `ok=false`, Goal/optional Agent identity, and the actionable `error`.
Use Markdown output for human generator diagnostics or a non-thin JSON mode
for the richer generator packet; neither is the recurring Agent hot path.

The heartbeat envelope ceiling covers the unbound and representative agent/scope-bound
Codex App thin fixtures. It includes generator metadata and repeated bound commands,
not only the execution prompt. The shared host contract added static safety, repair
routing, and retry-stable Turn initialization; the scoped fixture now uses about
4,362 JSON characters. The 4,800-character ceiling leaves roughly 10% headroom for
that fixture, without relaxing the independent **2,500-character thin task body**,
4,000-character native Goal body, structural limits, or emitted CLI ceilings.
It is not a token count, execution quota, or allowance to append more instructions.
Arbitrary-length caller paths/scopes are not promised to fit this fixed fixture
envelope; their emitted output is qualified separately by the CLI matrix.
Do not remove safety or settlement semantics to fit the envelope, and do not copy
dynamic quota decisions into the static prompt. No prompt text, saved automation,
scheduler cadence, or spending policy changes with this qualification adjustment.

The quota budget includes the typed action portfolio, one shared bound CLI
route, pending-selection qualification, and hard-lane preemption evidence. The
budget retains modest headroom for those enforceable semantics; repeated action
details and command prefixes still belong in compact references or cold paths.

| Emitted Surface | Default Qualification | Scale / Limit Contract | Cold Path |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `start-goal --guided` | baseline and growth | small, crowded, and multi-agent goals; objective/command duplication | `packet_summary.detail_refs` and `bootstrap-command-pack` |
| `bootstrap-command-pack` | baseline and growth | small, crowded, and multi-agent goals; objective/command duplication | `--message-only` and `packet_summary.detail_refs` |
| `quota should-run` | absolute hot path | todo-count growth plus semantic anchors | `status`, `history`, active state, repeatable `--include-detail <section>` |
| `status --goal-id` | absolute hot path | todo-count growth; task graph excluded by default | `--include-task-graph`, `history`, run artifacts |
| `diagnose --goal-id` | explicit-limit cold path | `--limit 5` fixture matrix | status plus goal-specific quota/todo reads |
| `review-packet --handoff-only` | absolute hot path | todo-count growth plus handoff semantic anchors | full `review-packet`, run artifacts |
| `heartbeat-prompt --thin` | absolute hot path | agent scope, multi-agent fixture matrix, and exact Agent-input field allowlist | Markdown diagnostics, `--compact`, `--full` |
| `todo list` | baseline and growth | todo-count growth and agent filtering semantics | `--thin`, `--limit N`, role/status filters, direct todo-id lifecycle commands |
| `history --limit 5` | explicit-limit cold path | returned-run bound | individual run JSON/Markdown artifacts |
| `evidence-log --thin --limit 5` | explicit-limit cold path | returned-evidence bound | referenced run-history and rollout-event artifacts |

`quota should-run` uses one repeatable cold-path selector:
`--include-detail scheduler`, `agent-todos`, `user-todos`, or
`goal-boundary`; `--include-detail all` expands every section. Public docs,
emitted `detail_ref` commands, and internal callers use only this selector.
Unknown sections and selectors attached to another quota command fail before
status collection.

The canonical emitted-output inventory and current characterization ceilings
live in `loopx.control_plane.testing.cli_output_budget`. Those ceilings are
regression baselines, not target sizes: preserving a large current value makes
unreviewed growth fail while a later optimization lowers the ceiling. Tests
also record UTF-8 bytes, line count, JSON parseability, pretty-print overhead,
semantic anchors, collection-growth slope, and bootstrap duplication. Every
declared agent-facing surface must name an owner, consumer action, and cold-path
fallback.

The same matrix characterizes explicit mode switches instead of assuming that
the default command represents them. Covered variants are
`bootstrap-command-pack --message-only`, quota per-section and all-detail
selectors, TurnEnvelope output, status task-graph detail, the full review
packet, and the brief/compact/full heartbeat prompt modes. These remain opt-in
cold paths, but their exact stdout size and semantic anchors are regression
contracts too.

`todo list --thin` is an explicit bounded projection, not a new filtering or
ordering mode. After the normal role, status, Todo-id, and agent filters run,
it keeps at most two matched items per role in one top-level `todos` container.
The hot item shape keeps `text` and omits its redundant derived `title` field so
the maximum retained field shape stays inside the registered fixed budget.
The payload preserves the existing `todo_count` meaning, adds full-match
`matched_todo_count` plus `returned_todo_count` and `omitted_todo_count`, and
repeats per-role overflow readback in `payload_compaction`. Retained strings
and nested scope collections are bounded as declared by
`todo_list_thin_projection_v0`, while actionable identity and gate/monitor
relationship fields stay allowlisted. Local paths, note/evidence detail, and
duplicate summary lanes remain omitted.

`--limit N` composes by lowering the intrinsic per-role cap to `min(N, 2)`;
it never expands the thin projection. Use `todo list` without `--thin`, the
direct Todo-id cold path, or active state when omitted items or full fields are
required. Omitting `--thin` restores the existing full list shape without
changing Todo selection, ordering, quota, lifecycle, or write behavior.

The start and daily command groups in the public help surface, plus
`heartbeat-prompt`, are fail-closed inventory inputs. Each command must map to
a default qualified surface or carry an explicit cold-path exception with a
rationale. The canary planner selects the output-budget profile for CLI command,
help, implementation, fixture, workflow, or budget-contract changes, and PR CI
runs the matrix as a named step.

The qualification also runs the same public fixture against `origin/main` and
the candidate checkout. It allows only policy-sized growth for each surface and
format, rather than treating one global percentage as safe. A smaller candidate
still fails when it removes a declared semantic key or changes an existing
`action_signature` semantic contract. Removed observed nested JSON paths or
Markdown headings are reported as review signals: sensitive output reductions
must account for them in human review, while an intentional presentation or
structural refactor does not become a permanent CI red light.
The receipts contain counts, shape paths, headings, and digests only; they do
not persist raw CLI output. Candidate-only surfaces are allowed after their
absolute characterization passes, while removing a qualified base row fails
closed.

Both budget layers are intentionally about projections, not the full archival
facts. When a surface needs more detail, put that detail behind a queryable
cold-path command or a linked run-history artifact instead of making the
recurring heartbeat prompt carry it. `nested_keys` counts dictionary keys
through three payload levels and samples at most 20 list items per level; it is
a hot-path structure budget, not an archival record-size budget.

Restraint rules for new fields:

1. Prefer adding evidence to run history, then projecting only the smallest
   decision summary into a hot-path surface.
2. A hot-path field must answer a current consumer action. If the consumer only
   says "nice to inspect", keep the field in the cold path.
3. A new nested object must either stay within the nested budget above or retire
   / compact an older field in the same surface.
4. Do not add prompt branches to compensate for an unclear payload. Clarify the
   status/quota/review-packet contract instead.
5. If a short worker would need to read more than one hot-path payload before it
   can choose the next action, demote the extra detail to a cold-path command.

The quota guard keeps top-level `action_required` and `open_count` as compact
compatibility aliases for older heartbeat/host prompts; the authoritative
structured fields remain `interaction_contract.user_channel` and
`user_todo_summary`.

Cadence contract:

The same smoke also emits and validates an `interface_budget_cadence` summary
for clean drift checks. A drift-check run may record that summary in run
history; `loopx status` projects it under
`attention_queue.items[].project_asset.interface_budget_cadence`, and
`quota should-run` mirrors the selected goal summary at top level. This lets a
short heartbeat quiet-skip a still-fresh clean check without losing the ongoing
guard todo.

Stable cadence fields:

- `checked_at`: when the hot-path budget check was run.
- `freshness_hours`: how long the clean check remains fresh.
- `next_check_due_at`: when the next check is due.
- `overdue`: whether the current summary is past `next_check_due_at`.
- `within_budget`: whether all measured hot-path surfaces fit their budgets.
- `minimum_headroom_ratio`, `tightest_surface`, `tightest_metric`, and
  `headroom_remaining`: compact headroom evidence for the tightest observed
  surface.
- `recommendation`: either `quiet_skip_until_next_check_due` or
  `rerun_hot_path_interface_budget_smoke`. Fresh checks only quiet-skip when
  every surface is within budget and the tightest metric still has positive
  headroom; a zero-headroom surface is already at the compatibility edge and
  should rerun the smoke before more hot-path growth is accepted.

Do not add a heartbeat prompt branch for this cadence. Store exact measurements
in run history, project only this compact decision summary, and rerun the smoke
when `overdue=true`, when `headroom_remaining <= 0`, or when a
prompt/status/quota/review-packet/dashboard contract changes.

Scheduler reset policy budget:

`quota should-run.scheduler_hint.reset_policy` is a host-action summary, not a
debug snapshot. It carries the reset token, host state key, initial Codex App
RRULE, unchanged-state clear flag, and short identity/profile signatures needed
to detect reset transitions. Full identity/profile snapshots stay off the hot
path; use status, history, active state, or a focused regression fixture when
debugging why a reset token changed.
