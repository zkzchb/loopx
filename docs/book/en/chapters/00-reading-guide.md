# How to use this book

This book is for external developers who already use Git, a terminal, and at least one agent development
tool. You do not need to read the LoopX Kernel source or learn every CLI subcommand first.

## What you will accomplish

Six numbered chapters plus one state-machine map establish one control-plane model. The book then
branches into two independent practice paths:

```text
Control-plane foundations
├── Connect an existing Git project
└── Make a developer contribution
    ├── Control Plane, Capabilities, and Domain State
    ├── Providers, Hosts/Runners, projections, docs, and fixtures
    └── Extensions and independent package lifecycle
```

The foundation sequence covers:

1. why one session is insufficient for long-running work;
2. which state belongs to an agent session, a Host Goal, and LoopX;
3. canonical state, workbenches, events, and read-only projections;
4. Todo graphs, Gates, claims, leases, authority, and peer collaboration;
   then [Core state machines and transitions](./core-state-machines.md) connects source state, derived
   decisions, projections, and the nine cooperating state-machine families in one map;
5. how one governed Turn is decided, executed, validated, and written back;
6. retry, replan, self-repair, terminal closure, and runtime boundaries.

## How the Dev Book and Control-Plane Course work together

This book and the repository's
[Control-Plane Developer Course](/loopx/docs/development/control-plane-course/)
serve different reading jobs:

- the **Dev Book** gives external developers a complete-enough mechanism model, then helps them onboard a
  project or deliver a public contribution;
- the **Control-Plane Course** serves developers who need to enter Kernel, CLI, state-projection, or
  scheduler implementation through Showcase derivations, decision tables, source walkthroughs,
  experiments, and review questions.

They share the official protocols and source as authority, but do not maintain two copies of the complete
course. The Dev Book explains enough mechanism to predict behavior. Follow its chapter-level pointers into
the course when you need rule precedence, bounded-context placement, or implementation detail. The deep
course is currently maintained in Chinese; the English Dev Book keeps the mechanism needed for its main
paths self-contained.
Developers ready to enter Kernel implementation can go directly to the
[independent Control-Plane Course chapter](./12-control-plane-course.md).

- **How do short sessions compose into long-running work?** Read Chapters 1 and 2, then descend into the
  [concept primer](/loopx/docs/development/control-plane-course/00-concept-primer/),
  [Lesson 1: Harness is the effectful program](/loopx/docs/development/control-plane-course/01-agent-loop-effectful-program/),
  and [Lesson 2](/loopx/docs/development/control-plane-course/02-goal-control-plane-architecture/), then walk
  through a real Loop in [Lesson 3](/loopx/docs/development/control-plane-course/03-first-real-loop/).
- **Who owns state, the work graph, and authority?** Read Chapters 3 and 4 plus
  [Core state machines and transitions](./core-state-machines.md), then descend into
  [Lesson 4](/loopx/docs/development/control-plane-course/04-state-substrate/) and
  [Lesson 5](/loopx/docs/development/control-plane-course/05-work-graph-and-peers/).
- **Which rule wins when a Gate, Monitor, and Replan coexist?** Read
  [Core state machines and transitions](./core-state-machines.md) and Chapter 5, then descend into
  [Lesson 6](/loopx/docs/development/control-plane-course/06-quota-decision-kernel/) and
  [Lesson 7](/loopx/docs/development/control-plane-course/07-host-scheduler-and-heartbeat/).
- **How does long-running work avoid drift and local loops?** Read Chapter 6, then descend into
  [long-horizon convergence](/loopx/docs/development/control-plane-course/topic-long-horizon-convergence/)
  and [Lesson 8](/loopx/docs/development/control-plane-course/08-evidence-refresh-and-self-repair/).
- **How do I change a rule and prove it is deliverable?** Read Chapters 10 through 13, then descend into
  [Lesson 9](/loopx/docs/development/control-plane-course/09-engineering-a-control-plane-rule/) and
  [Lesson 10](/loopx/docs/development/control-plane-course/10-autonomous-agent-quality-gates/).
- **How do Extensions, domain capabilities, and the Kernel compose?** Read Chapters 14 through 16, then
  descend into [Lesson 11](/loopx/docs/development/control-plane-course/11-extension-layer/).

After those chapters:

- to learn the daily 1.0 operator surface first, start with
  [Operate the LoopX 1.0 Workspace](./workspace-v1.md);
- to manage your own repository, start with
  [Connect an existing Git project](./05-connect-existing-project.md);
- to make any public LoopX contribution, start with the
  [Developer contribution map](./source-protocol-map.md);
- once you know the contribution needs independent installation, activation, and upgrades, continue to
  [Choose the right extension point](./08-extension-placement.md).

The paths share the same foundations but do not depend on each other. Extension lifecycle is one
developer-contribution path, not the default destination for every contribution.

## How chapters are organized

Each chapter prioritizes four questions:

1. What job does the reader need to complete now?
2. What observable result proves success?
3. Which concepts are necessary to predict the behavior?
4. Where should the reader recover when the normal path fails?

Command snippets fall into three categories:

- **Runnable:** checked against the stated LoopX baseline.
- **Based on the official scaffold:** the example focuses on the domain changes, protocol, and validation
  needed for the task without a separate exercise repository.
- **Simplified for explanation:** illustrates a state relationship and must not be pasted into production
  configuration.

## Sources of authority

The English and Chinese editions share the same product facts. The Chinese root edition is the editorial
source of truth; the English edition is organized for English-speaking external developers rather than
maintained as a separate product specification. The two editions are semantic mirrors: a material
difference in version facts, status, commands, boundaries, or conclusions is a documentation defect.

| Subject | Authority |
| --- | --- |
| CLI arguments, protocols, and runtime behavior | LoopX releases, current `--help`, and the official repository |
| Learning path, scaffold guidance, explanations, and trade-off guidance | This book |
| Kernel source walkthroughs, combined cases, decision tables, and experiment routes | Control-Plane Developer Course |
| Facts about your project | Git, CI, external services, and project-owned sources |

When the book and a current release disagree, follow the release first and report the documentation drift.
Do not bypass a newer permission or lifecycle check just to make an older example pass.

## Version baseline

The current release anchor is LoopX GitHub release `v1.0.3`. Local command examples were checked against
the public `loopx 1.0.3` CLI and protocol surface. This release requires Python 3.11+ and Node.js 22.6+.
LoopX starts and reuses its managed, idle-exiting TypeScript Effect runtime automatically; users do not
operate that runtime as a manual daemon.

A release tag, installed CLI, and source checkout can be on different revisions, so verify these surfaces
against your actual environment:

- install and update;
- Host activation;
- the `start-goal` guided packet;
- Codex App heartbeat, visible Codex CLI Goal behavior, and other optional Hosts;
- TypeScript Effect runtime readiness;
- Extension manifest and lifecycle commands.

Before running commands from the book:

```bash
loopx --version
loopx doctor
node --version
```

If your version differs, inspect current command help and release notes before deciding whether you found
documentation drift, a release difference, or a product behavior change. This book does not guess what
different version identifiers imply.

### How to read the TypeScript migration

`v0.5.4` does not mean that all of LoopX has been rewritten in TypeScript. The current release baseline is:

- TypeScript owns the canonical semantics for migrated slices of the Effect Program, Turn and Host Todo
  settlement, Todo completion, quota delivery/spend/void/monitor-poll, the local task-lease lifecycle,
  Vision refresh, governed capability validation, and scheduler heartbeat/state;
- during the migration, the Python CLI still owns transport, legacy response projection, explicit
  external Provider calls, and some Markdown/event writeback;
- each migrated rule has one semantic owner. A Python facade adapts a TypeScript transaction; it must not
  become a second independent decision implementation;
- current `main` is in the transaction-payoff phase: later progress is measured by complete transaction
  cutovers and deleted legacy semantics, not by accumulating leaf helpers and bridge calls.

Treat the `v0.5.4` tag and release notes as the shipped baseline. Use the current status of the
[TypeScript Control-Plane Migration RFC](/loopx/docs/architecture/rfcs/typescript-control-plane-migration-v0/)
for later cutovers and final CLI/App convergence. `v0.5.4` ships only the first receipt-bound scheduler
follow-up slice of Stage 3; broader CLI/App convergence and Stage 4 distribution cleanup remain future
work.

### Updating your mental model from `v0.4.4` to `v0.5.4`

If you read an earlier edition of the Dev Book, recalibrate these four areas first:

| Area | Shipped in `v0.5.4` | Continue with |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Control Plane | Complete Turn/Host Todo settlement, quota commit, task-lease lifecycle, Vision refresh, and scheduler-heartbeat transactions have typed TypeScript owners; Python facades still carry migration-time boundaries | [Migration RFC](/loopx/docs/architecture/rfcs/typescript-control-plane-migration-v0/) |
| Operator surface | Personal Workspace exposes Goal, Task, Chat, and read-only status-source entrypoints; the UI is not a new source of truth | [Dashboard README](https://github.com/huangruiteng/loopx/blob/v0.5.4/apps/presentation/dashboard/README.md) |
| Host runtime | Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode, Pi, KunlunCode, DeepSeek Harness, and custom runners have distinct activation and stop contracts | [Runtime Connector Catalog](/loopx/docs/integrations/runtime-connector-catalog/) |
| Capability and Provider | A Capability is defined by a package-owned catalog entry, a real command, and durable validation; a Provider or Extension does not inherit Kernel authority | [Capability Catalog](/loopx/docs/capabilities/) |
| Shared authority | File, NoKV, and PostgreSQL providers remain staged candidates; installing a Provider does not change the default local authority | [Shared Authority RFC](/loopx/docs/architecture/rfcs/shared-goal-authority-state-provider-v0/) |

This table is a reading map, not a copy of the release notes. Confirm whether a surface is usable through
the installed release's `doctor`, `capability show`, Host readback, and versioned documentation.

### From `v0.5.4` into the `v1.0.0` Workspace

The `v1.0.0` product milestone is the Personal Workspace, not blanket promotion of every staged
authority path or optional Provider. It brings cross-Goal overview, Agent lanes, completed work,
Capability settings, verified reports, Goal Channels, and desktop recovery into one operator surface
while preserving the authority of the CLI, typed Kernel, and project state. Follow the
[1.0 Workspace operations chapter](./workspace-v1.md) through startup, readback,
preview/apply/receipt, configuration, and disable checks before entering the project-onboarding or
developer-contribution path.

## Deliberate scope

The developer-contribution path covers placement, protocol maps, rule changes, Capabilities and Providers,
Hosts and Runners, projections, documentation and fixtures, Extension lifecycle, validation, and PR
delivery. It does not duplicate the complete maintainer course or a full CLI reference.
Production effectful Providers, private organizational cases, and live benchmark operation remain outside
the main path. Use official source, protocol documentation, and the target project's own facts for those
workflows.
